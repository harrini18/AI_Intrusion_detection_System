Problem Stament - AI Powered Intrustion Detection System Using MicroControllers
ðŸ“¡ WiFi Intrusion Detection System Dashboard
Overview This project is a WiFi Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to monitor nearby WiFi networks and detect potential security threats. The system visualizes real-time network data, highlighting rogue networks and analyzing signal strength and security types through interactive charts. It uses HTML, Bootstrap, and Chart.js for the front end, with JavaScript to handle dynamic data updates.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
Real-Time Network Scanning: Fetches data from an API to display available WiFi networks, including SSID, BSSID, Signal Strength (RSSI), and Encryption type. Threat Detection & Alerts: Identifies and alerts users about insecure (Open) networks through blinking alerts and color-coded tables.

Data Visualization: Line Chart: Shows signal strength variations for each network. Bar Chart: Displays the distribution of security types (e.g., WPA, WPA2, Open). Dynamic Threat Analysis Table: Provides a detailed overview of each network's security status. Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap for optimal viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.
